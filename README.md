# Image-Classification-using-Neural-Network-in-Python

In this project, I have built up on the previous Logistic Regression Classifier using the same dataset of 250 Cat and Non-cat images of size 64*64 pixels. However, I have used a deep neural network of 3 hidden layers and there is an improvement, giving an accuracy of 80%.
Check the cost vs Iteration graph to see the cost decreasing after every iteration to be able to choose the optimal number of iterations.

The model accuracy can be further improved by using Regularization for overfitting and tuning the hyperparameters, which I will be working on further. 

A few types of images the model tends to do poorly on include:

1)Cat body in an unusual position
2)Cat appears against a background of a similar color
3)Unusual cat color and species
4)Camera Angle
5)Brightness of the picture
6)Scale variation (cat is very large or small in image)

Check the comments section of the project for more clarification.

Any suggestions are welcomed !
